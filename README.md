A Responsive Web application for hospital management based on HTML5 CSS Bootstrap 4 JS and PHP
---
The purpose of this mission is to develop a web application that can be used to keep track of patients registered in a hospital. This application will be used by the receptionist to follow the patients registered during their hospital stay.
In addition, this system could support features such as access to any patient's previous visits, search for patients by name and other attributes, etc.

#### Some of the more general requirements of the system are:

  ✓ register patients
  
  ✓ connect securely to use the system
  
  ✓ find and classify patients by name, date of admission and discharge
  
  ✓ view previous visits of any patient
  
  ✓ maintain the list of doctors in the hospital
  
  ✓ maintain the list of available beds / rooms in the hospital
  
  ✓ classify patients according to the departments concerned.
